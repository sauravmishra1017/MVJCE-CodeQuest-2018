Problem:

Meet Tony Stark. He's a billionaire with genius level intellect. He's also CEO of Stark Industries. 
Mr. Stark's company has just developed technology that allows one level of encrypting a string. But unfortunately, his ignorant developers forgot to create the corresponding decryption algorithm.
Help Mr. Stark's company build the decryption algorithm in any programming language. Implement an algorithm to decrypt a cipher. Remember, you can have alphabets, numerals or symbols. (Hint: The output will be each character of the cipher text minus the offset).
Fabricating the results will leave Stark's company vulnerable to threats from his arch nemesis, Thanos. So, do not fabricate the results.

Input:
Cipher text and offset value is fed as input by Stark's developers.

Output:
Decrypted text is displayed.

Example:
Input:
a2db678 6

Output:
[,^\012

Input:
Xlersw 4

Output:
Thanos
