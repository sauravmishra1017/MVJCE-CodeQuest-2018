Omprakash created 3 machines to help him with generation of a random number.
M1 generates a random number
M2 generates another random number
M3 then concatenates the numbers generated by the above machines in the order M1M2 to form the final random number.
He creates the machines in such a way that numbers generated by M1 have either the same number of digits as M2 or have one extra digit compared to M2.
Example 1: M1=123 , M2=12 , Hence M3=12312
Example 2: M1=56 , M2=78 , Hence M3=5678

Omprakash now wants to sort these numbers generated by M3 based on the following logic.
He finds an Equivalent Sort Value(ESV) for each number generated by M3.
ESV for an M3 number is the difference between numbers generated by M1 and M2 for that number.
He now need to sort the numbers generated by Machine 3 in ascending order based on each of their ESV's and ignore it if ESV's are same.
Example : Number from M3=1234, Equivalent Sort Value(ESV) = Difference of 12 and 34 = 22 (Note: Difference is always a positive value)

Can you help him to sort these numbers?

Input:
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. 
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines.
First line is an integer N and second line is N number of M numbers generated by M3.

Output:
Output contains T lines, each line starts with the string "Case #x: " where 'x' is the test case number and is then followed by the sorted array.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000
2≤M≤10^5

Sample Input:

13 21

999 386 238 1631

Sample Output:
Case #1: 21 13
Case #2: 238 1631 386 999

EXPLANATION:

Case #1
In 21, difference between 2 and 1 is '1' and in 13, the difference between 1 and 3
is '2'. Since 1 ≤ 3, the order becomes 21 13.

Case #2
In 999, difference between 99 and 9 is 90. In 386, the difference between 38 and 6 is 30. In 238, difference between 23 and 8 is 15 and in 1631, difference between 16 and 31 is 15. Therefore, 15 ≤ 15 ≤ 30 ≤ 90

Notice that the difference '15' is common for both 238 and 1631. Since 238 ≤ 1631, 
238 will come before 1631. So the final order will be '238 1631 386 999'
